This progression matches the document's principle of not immediately building a complex multi-agent system and instead evolving the architecture progressively.

## What I recommend for your learning

Since your goal is learning AI engineering from design → production, don't treat this as just a project to finish.

At every step, learn three things:

```text
1. CONCEPT
   ↓
2. IMPLEMENTATION
   ↓
3. FAILURE MODES
```

For example:

### Step 6 — Project Name + Business Outcome

You learn:

```text
LLM
 └── Prompt
      └── Structured Output
           └── Pydantic
                └── Validation
```

Then deliberately test:

```text
vague project descriptions
incomplete descriptions
contradictory requirements
very long descriptions
hallucinated business outcomes
malformed LLM responses
```

That is where the real AI-engineering learning happens.

## Your first milestone

I would make Steps 1–6 your first milestone:

Input:

```text
"Build an AI system that classifies corporate documents."
```

Output:

```text
Project Name:
Corporate Document Classification System

Business Outcome:
Automatically classify corporate documents into
appropriate security categories to improve document
handling and reduce manual classification effort.
```

Once that works reliably, we move to the full blueprint.
