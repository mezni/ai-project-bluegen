# AI Project Blueprint Generator

An agentic AI learning project that transforms a simple AI project idea into a structured, implementation-ready architecture blueprint.

The project is built progressively with **Python, Pydantic, LangChain, and OpenRouter**, starting with a simple structured LLM application and evolving toward a production-oriented agentic AI system.

---

## 1. Project Goal

The goal is to build an AI architecture assistant that can take a high-level project idea such as:

```text
Build an AI system that classifies corporate documents
as Public, Internal, Confidential, or Secret.
```

and transform it into a structured architecture blueprint.

The final system will reason about:

* Business outcome
* Requirements
* Boundaries
* Constraints
* Agents
* Orchestration
* Context
* State
* Memory
* Knowledge
* Actions
* Authority
* Runtime
* Recovery
* Evaluation
* Observability
* Security
* Responsible AI

The project is also a practical learning journey for **AI engineering from design to production**.

---

## 2. Learning Philosophy

The system will **not** start as a complex multi-agent application.

It will evolve incrementally:

```text

      ↓
Single Blueprint Generator
      ↓
Pipeline
      ↓
Agentic Architecture
      ↓
Tools
      ↓

      ↓
Observability
      ↓
Security
      ↓
CI/CD
      ↓
FinOps
      ↓
Production
```

At each stage, the objective is to understand:

```text
Concept
   ↓
Implementation
   ↓
Failure Modes
   ↓
Evaluation
   ↓
Production Considerations
```

---

## 3. First Feature

The first functional feature is intentionally small.

### Input

```text
Build an AI system that classifies corporate documents.
```

### Output

```text
Project Name:
Corporate Document Classification System

Business Outcome:
Automatically classify corporate documents into appropriate
security categories to improve document handling and reduce
manual classification effort.
```

This establishes the foundation for the larger blueprint generator.

---

## 5. Architecture Evolution

### Level 1 — Structured LLM

The first version is intentionally simple:

```text
User
 │
 ▼
Project Idea
 │
 ▼
Prompt
 │
 ▼
OpenRouter LLM
 │
 ▼
Pydantic Validation
 │
 ▼
Structured Blueprint
```

The initial learning topics are:

* Prompt engineering
* LangChain
* OpenRouter
* Pydantic
* Structured output

---

### Level 2 — Pipeline

The generator will eventually be decomposed into stages:

```text
Project Idea
     │
     ▼
Requirements Analysis
     │
     ▼
Architecture Design
     │
     ▼
Security Analysis
     │
     ▼
Architecture Critique
     │
     ▼
Final Blueprint
```

Learning topics:

* LCEL
* Chains
* Pipeline composition
* State
* Decomposition
* Validation

---

### Level 3 — Agentic Architecture

Specialized responsibilities will eventually become agents:

```text
                  User
                    │
                    ▼
              Orchestrator
                    │
       ┌────────────┼────────────┐
       ▼            ▼            ▼
Requirements   Architecture   Security
   Agent          Agent         Agent
       │            │            │
       └────────────┼────────────┘
                    ▼
               Critic Agent
                    │
                    ▼
             Blueprint Builder
                    │
                    ▼
             Final Blueprint
```

The system will only introduce agents where autonomous reasoning provides value.

Deterministic operations should remain normal application code.

---

## 6. AI vs Deterministic Code

A core architectural principle is:

> Use AI for ambiguity and reasoning. Use deterministic code for rules and guarantees.

### LLM responsibilities

Examples:

* Requirements analysis
* Architecture reasoning
* Risk analysis
* Architecture critique
* Business outcome generation

### Python responsibilities

Examples:

* Schema validation
* Authentication
* Authorization
* Permission enforcement
* Saving data
* Deterministic calculations
* Rule enforcement
* Tool access control

This separation prevents unnecessary use of LLMs for tasks that can be guaranteed by normal software.

---

## 7. Future Tools

Agents will eventually have access to controlled tools such as:

```text
search_architecture_patterns()
retrieve_security_policy()
retrieve_reference_architecture()
search_company_standards()
estimate_cost()
validate_blueprint()
save_blueprint()
request_human_review()
```

Tools will have explicit permissions and authority boundaries.

---

## 8. Knowledge and RAG

A future version will introduce a knowledge layer.

Potential knowledge sources:

```text
security-policies
architecture-standards
ai-governance
reference-architectures
cloud-standards
data-governance
ai-operations
```

The architecture will evolve toward:

```text
Documents
    │
    ▼
Document Loader
    │
    ▼
Chunking
    │
    ▼
Embeddings
    │
    ▼
Vector Store
    │
    ▼
Retriever
    │
    ▼
Architecture Agent
```

This allows agents to ground architecture decisions in authoritative information.

---

## 9. Context Design

Agents should receive only the context required for their task.

Potential context:

```text
User Request
Project Requirements
Current Blueprint
Relevant Policies
Retrieved Knowledge
Previous Agent Results
Available Tools
```

The entire project history should not automatically be placed into every prompt.

---

## 10. State, Memory and Knowledge

These concepts will be treated separately.

### State

Temporary information required by the current workflow.

Examples:

```text
current architecture
current review
current evaluation score
revision count
```

### Memory

Information intentionally retained across interactions.

Examples:

```text
user architecture preferences
preferred cloud platform
```

### Knowledge

External authoritative information retrieved when needed.

Examples:

```text
company policies
security standards
reference architectures
```

---

## 11. Authority

Agents will have explicit authority boundaries.

For example:

### Architecture Agent

Can:

```text
Propose architecture
Recommend technologies
Retrieve architecture patterns
```

Cannot:

```text
Deploy infrastructure
Modify production systems
Approve security exceptions
Access unrelated sensitive information
```

The project will apply least-privilege principles.

---

## 12. Human-in-the-Loop

High-risk actions should be able to stop for human approval.

```text
Agent
  │
  ▼
Proposed Action
  │
  ▼
Risk Assessment
  │
  ├── Low Risk ──────► Execute
  │
  └── High Risk ─────► Human Approval
                           │
                    ┌──────┴──────┐
                    ▼             ▼
                 Approve        Reject
                    │             │
                    ▼             ▼
                 Execute         Stop
```

---

## 13. Recovery

Agentic systems must expect failure.

The future system will handle cases such as:

```text
LLM Failure
    ↓
Retry
    ↓
Fallback Model
    ↓
Human Escalation
```

Other failure scenarios include:

```text
Invalid structured output
    ↓
Schema validation
    ↓
Retry

Tool unavailable
    ↓
Retry
    ↓
Fallback

Knowledge unavailable
    ↓
Fail safely

Too many revisions
    ↓
Human review
```

---

## 14. Evaluation

The generated blueprint should be evaluated rather than blindly accepted.

Potential evaluation dimensions:

* Requirements completeness
* Architecture quality
* Security coverage
* Constraint coverage
* Grounding
* Hallucination rate
* Tool-use correctness
* Citation correctness
* Business outcome quality

A future evaluation dataset will contain representative project ideas and expected characteristics.

---

## 15. Observability

The production system will eventually capture:

```text
Request ID
Model
Prompt version
Input
Output
Retrieved knowledge
Tool calls
Latency
Token usage
Errors
Retries
Evaluation results
Human overrides
```

This makes the system measurable and debuggable.

---

## 16. Security and Responsible AI

The system will eventually address:

* Sensitive information protection
* Access control
* Least privilege
* Prompt injection
* Data leakage
* Audit logging
* Human approval
* Output validation
* Agent authority
* Tool authorization
* Responsible AI controls

Security controls should be implemented primarily through deterministic application mechanisms rather than relying solely on prompts.

## 18. Initial Project Structure

Start intentionally small.

The current (Level 1) structure:

```text
ai-project-bluegen/
│
├── app.py                  # launcher → cli.main()
├── cli.py                  # replaceable CLI presentation layer
├── application.py          # Application + create_application (composition root, creates RequestContext)
├── container.py            # DependencyContainer (assembles infrastructure, never runs use cases)
├── context.py              # RequestContext (frozen request_id)

├── CHANGELOG.md
├── docs/

└── README.md
```

The structure grows only when the corresponding architectural concept is introduced. See `docs/STEPS.md` for the granular step-by-step progression (each step's architectural choice and why).

---

## 19. Long-Term Structure

The eventual architecture may evolve toward:

```text
blueprint-generator/
│
├── agents/
│   ├── requirements_agent.py
│   ├── architecture_agent.py
│   ├── security_agent.py
│   └── critic_agent.py
│
├── tools/
│   ├── policy_search.py
│   ├── architecture_search.py

├── config.py
├── app.py
│
├── tests/
│
├── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml
├── pyproject.toml
└── README.md
```

This structure is intentionally **not** created all at once.

---

6. Decompose complex work into appropriate stages.
7. Use specialized agents when justified.
8. Use controlled tools.
9. Ground decisions in retrieved knowledge.
10. Maintain explicit workflow state.
11. Apply authority boundaries.

---

## 21. Development Principle

The central principle of this project is:

```text
Start simple.
Understand the failure.
Measure the result.
Add complexity only when it solves a real problem.
```

The goal is not simply to build an agent.

The goal is to understand how to design, build, evaluate, secure, observe, operate, and deploy **production-grade AI systems**.
